My solution is not complete as somewhere in the middle I have realized
that I took a wrong approach. The mobile and tablet versions are working.
I could finish the desktop version but I am not sure that it makes sense.
I should have used a container and render there the menu via JS instead of trying
to accomplish the task from the CSS angle.

Instead of px I used em/rem as the were no PixelPerfect requirement
It is a proof of concept without routing.
TBD: some tweaks, like adding transition for a smooth experience
